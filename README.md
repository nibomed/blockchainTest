## About

1. This repository, including this README file, was written by Bing AI.
2. The author of the AI prompt has little to no knowledge about Metamask, UI, blockchain, etc.
3. This code demonstrates how to interact with a smart contract on the Sepolia Testnet using Metamask and web3.js. It includes a simple user interface for performing math operations using a Calculator contract.
4. This is a test task for a junior IT application.

## Usage

To use this code, you will need to have Metamask installed and connected to the Sepolia Testnet. You will also need to have some test ETH in your Metamask wallet to interact with the contract.
