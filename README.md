# Blockchain Calculator

This is a simple blockchain calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations using an Ethereum smart contract. The calculator's user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it interacts with the Ethereum blockchain using the Metamask browser extension.

## Usage

To use the calculator, open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Make sure you have the Metamask browser extension installed and connected to the Sepolia Testnet. Enter two numbers into the input fields and select an operation from the dropdown menu. Click on the "Calculate" button to perform the calculation. The result will be displayed in the result field.

## Credits

99% of the code for this project was written by an AI language model from OpenAI as part of a test task for a junior role in Ukraine.
